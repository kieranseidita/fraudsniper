# Dataset Information

## Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

The original credit card fraud dataset used in this project is **not included** in this repository due to privacy and licensing restrictions.

You can download the dataset for free from Kaggle here:  
[Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

### Instructions

1. Download the dataset CSV file from the Kaggle link above.  
2. Place the downloaded `creditcard.csv` file inside this `data/` folder locally on your machine before running any scripts or notebooks.  

### Why is the dataset not included?

- The dataset contains sensitive transaction data and is subject to licensing agreements.  
- Keeping the dataset out of the repo helps maintain privacy and avoids repository bloat.

### Additional Notes

- All data processing and model training scripts assume the dataset CSV is located at `data/creditcard.csv`.  
- Ensure you have the correct file path when loading the dataset in your code.
